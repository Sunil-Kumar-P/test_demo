                <p>Skin care is the range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve
                    skin conditions. They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and appropriate use
                    of emollients. Practices that enhance appearance include the use of cosmetics, botulinum,
                    exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, peels, retinol therapyand ultrasonic
                    skin treatment.Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such as skin that is
                    either too dry or too moist, and prevention of dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries </p>

                    <li>Protect yourself from the sun</li>
                    <div class="para">One of the most important ways to take care of your skin is to protect it from the
                        sun. A
                        lifetime of sun exposure can cause wrinkles, age spots and other skin problems — as well as
                        increase the risk of skin cancer. <br>
                        For the most complete sun protection: <br>

                        <b> Use sunscreen</b>. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Apply
                        sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or
                        perspiring. <br>
                        <b>Seek shade.</b> Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the sun's rays are strongest.
                        <br>
                        <b>Wear protective clothing.</b>Cover your skin with tightly woven long-sleeved shirts, long
                        pants and wide-brimmed hats. Also consider laundry additives, which give clothing an additional
                        layer of ultraviolet protection for a certain number of washings, or special sun-protective
                        clothing — which is specifically designed to block ultraviolet rays. <br>
                    </div>
                    <li>Don't smoken</li>
                    <div class="para">Smoking makes your skin look older and contributes to wrinkles. Smoking narrows
                        the tiny blood
                        vessels in the outermost layers of skin, which decreases blood flow and makes skin paler. This
                        also
                        depletes the skin of oxygen and nutrients that are important to skin health. <br>
                        Smoking also damages collagen and elastin — the fibers that give your skin strength and
                        elasticity.
                        In addition, the repetitive facial expressions you make when smoking — such as pursing your lips
                        when inhaling and squinting your eyes to keep out smoke — can contribute to wrinkles. <br>
                        In addition, smoking increases your risk of squamous cell skin cancer. If you smoke, the best
                        way to
                        protect your skin is to quit. Ask your doctor for tips or treatments to help you stop smoking.

                    <li>Treat your skin gently</li>
                    <div class="para">Daily cleansing and shaving can take a toll on your skin. To keep it gentle:

                        <b> Limit bath time </b>. Hot water and long showers or baths remove oils from your skin. Limit
                        your bath or
                        shower time, and use warm — rather than hot — water. <br>
                        <b>Avoid strong soaps.</b> Strong soaps and detergents can strip oil from your skin. Instead,
                        choose mild
                        cleansers. <br>
                        <b>Shave carefully.</b> To protect and lubricate your skin, apply shaving cream, lotion or gel
                        before
                        shaving. For the closest shave, use a clean, sharp razor. Shave in the direction the hair grows,
                        not
                        against it. <br>
                        <b>Pat dry.</b> After washing or bathing, gently pat or blot your skin dry with a towel so that
                        some
                        moisture remains on your skin. <br>
                        <b>Moisturize dry skin.</b> If your skin is dry, use a moisturizer that fits your skin type. For
                        daily use,
                        consider a moisturizer that contains SPF. <br>

                    </div>
                    <li>Eat a healthy diet</li>
                    <div class="para">A healthy diet can help you look and feel your best. Eat plenty of fruits,
                        vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins. The association between diet and acne isn't clear —
                        but some research suggests that a diet rich in fish oil or fish oil supplements and low in
                        unhealthy fats and processed or refined carbohydrates might promote younger looking skin.
                        Drinking plenty of water helps keep your skin hydrated.

                    </div>
                    <li> Manage stress</li>
                    <div class="para">Uncontrolled stress can make your skin more sensitive and trigger acne breakouts
                        and other skin problems. To encourage healthy skin — and a healthy state of mind — take steps to
                        manage your stress. Get enough sleep, set reasonable limits, scale back your to-do list and make
                        time to do the things you enjoy. The results might be more dramatic than you expect.</div>
